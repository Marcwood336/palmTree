<p className={classes.paragraph} >Coding is where the magic happens. As we already mentioned design must transcend all the aspects of a project, the aesthetic ones as well as the structural ones. The code determines the logic underlying the graphic interface, hence code must align with the features established during the designing phase and reflect the designing choices. The first programming language I learned was PHP which I quickly replaced with more modern and efficent programming languages, to be precise javascript based frameworks.</p>
